# Abstract

In an increasingly online world, security is more important than ever. Strong passwords and code that is resistant to exploits are important, but they're only part of the system. How do we save confidential data so that no one can access them? More importantly, how do we transmit that data from the user's computer to the web service without risking it being intercepted in transit? The answer is encryption. Much of the web is now encrypted---any website beginning with HTTPS, for example, communicates over an encrypted connection. However, not all devices communicate over secure connections. Off-brand home cameras and baby monitors are a popular target, as are smart fridges with cameras and anything that has a speaker and a WiFi connection. While there are many solutions to make these systems more secure (secure the client, secure the server, various means of encryption), I have chosen to explore adding secure encryption to the client application by utilizing the open-source Signal Protocol (an encryption protocol for communications over the internet) to secure communication on a simple client-server system.
